HI there,


i am currenty pursuing my course on front end. Now i am profocient in Html css and javascript. i am learnning react now. sorry for not usiing the react in this project.

But i can tell you interesting skills i have. i  have done certification as UI/UX designer from gooogle. And i know how to design, prototype and wriframes.I have experience with FIGMA with this we can design a reactive website. after finalizing the design developers will take care on project.

In the developing part also. i can  convert this designs into code in seconds with AI. i can act as designer and a developer. 

I applied for this internship to get hands on experience. so if you have a chance consider me. i am seeing this opportunity more as a learning and developing skills.

Thank you.
